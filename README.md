# Customer-Satisfaction-Analysis-NLP---NLTK

We have been contacted by an online women's clothing shop to assist them in making informed decisions regarding the product categories featured on their website, focusing on customer satisfaction. The shop offers five clothing categories: Tops, Bottoms, Jackets, Dresses, and Intimate.

**Our task is to determine which category has higher customer satisfaction.**

The shop has not maintained records of customer ratings, and the only available data consists of customer reviews in text format.

Our approach involves cleaning and preprocessing the raw text reviews using Python NLTK, followed by conducting sentiment analysis to assess customer satisfaction across product categories. 

**Through this systematic approach, we aim to provide the client with valuable insights that will aid them in optimizing their product offerings and overall customer experience.**

Task 1: Loading the Customer Reviews Dataset

Task 2: Clean and Preprocess the Reviews

Task 3: Tokenize the Reviews and Removing Stopwords

Task 4: Exploring the Tokens and Product Categories

Task 5: Extracting the Adjectives in the Reviews

Task 6: Finding the Sentiment of each Review
